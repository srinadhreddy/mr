In everyday usage, a vegetable is any part of a plant that is consumed by humans as food as part of a meal.<br>
 The term vegetable is somewhat arbitrary,<br>
 and largely defined through culinary and cultural tradition.<br>
 It normally excludes other food derived from plants such as fruits, nuts, and cereal grains, but includes seeds such as pulses<br>
. The original meaning of the word vegetable, <br>
still used in biology, was to describe all types of plant,<br>
 as in the terms "vegetable kingdom" and "vegetable matter".</p>
